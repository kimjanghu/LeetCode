# 201219 120 Triangle

Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle

```
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
```

The minimum path sum from top to bottom is `11` (i.e., **2** + **3** + **5** + **1** = 11).

**Note:**

Bonus point if you are able to do this using only *O*(*n*) extra space, where *n* is the total number of rows in the triangle.

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle):
        n = len(triangle)
        tmp = [[0] * i for i in range(1, n+1)]
        tmp[0][0] = triangle[0][0]
        if n == 1:
            return tmp[0][0]

        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i+1):
                if j == 0:
                    tmp[i][j] = triangle[i][j] + tmp[i-1][j]
                elif j == i:
                    tmp[i][j] = triangle[i][j] + tmp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    tmp[i][j] = min(triangle[i][j] + tmp[i-1][j-1], triangle[i][j] + tmp[i-1][j])
        return min(tmp[-1])
```
