Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]

Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,1,1]]

Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,2,1]]
```

 

**Note:**

1. The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.
2. There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.
3. The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.

                nx = x + di[k]
                ny = y + dj[k]
                if 0 <= nx < row and 0 <= ny < col and matrix[nx][ny] > pivot:
                    matrix[nx][ny] = pivot
                    q.append((nx, ny))
